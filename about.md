# About this site

This site can be seen as a blog, a showcase of my music and other
creations and experiments, or just a nice place to visit and
discover. It is made and maintained by myself as a statically
generated website. It started as handmade HTML and CSS styling. I
recently switched to using
[Stylus](https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) (those pretty colors
were a hassle) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to facilitate the
addition and management of content, but still keeping my own
HTML templates.

# About me

My name is Nicolas Gaborit, Soreine being my online name. I am a
French graduate in Computer Science from the ENSEEIHT in Toulouse. I
mainly [program](/prog/) or compose [music](/music/) but I have a
large array of other interests or hobbies, including a real passion
for video games.

Since I enjoy both games and algorithms, I love programming puzzles
and challenges. You can find me on
[Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/users/Soreine) or
[Codingame](https://www.codingame.com/profile/04928e763cd7e1dba698bee386f13206777182).
They always are a great way to improve one's mastery of new
languages. I have successfully learnt JavaScript (still using and
enjoying it today) and [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) this way, and I
am currently sharpening my understanding of functional programming
with the most beautiful incarnation of this paradigm, namely
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)

As I said, I have a long-standing passion for video games. As for
most, it started as a kid, as I was given the chance to play iconic
games such as Sonic, Rayman, Oddworld: Abe's Odyssey, Flashback and a
lot of others. I grew up with the
[Final Fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy) series
and I think listening to the OSTs helped me to get into piano and
later music since it was the first melodies that I tried to reproduce
on the piano. More recently I gave a try to e-sport with
[League of Legends](http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/news/esports) but I
could not keep up with the time investment it requires. But most
importantly, during the last years, I have been developing a love for
games with a strong sense of art. To name a few of the greatest :
[Flower](http://thatgamecompany.com/games/flower/),
[Journey](http://thatgamecompany.com/games/journey/) (that one is mind
blowing), [Hohokum](http://hohokum.playstation.com/),
[Monument Valley](http://www.monumentvalleygame.com/),
[FEZ](http://fezgame.com/) (this one has a grandiose feeling of
freedom). This is a kind of games it is definitely worth working for,
as an artist or as an engineer.
