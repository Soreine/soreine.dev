    There is a cooperation game experiment named
    <em>Swap Box Turbo</em> whose concept is simple yet funny. Both players
    control a little square that can jump across platforms. The level is
    scrolling and the squares die when they fall or when they touch each other.
    It's nothing more than a two-player scrolling platformer except from that
    very detail : every two seconds, both players controls are swapped. The
    result is a game of concentration, rhythm and cooperation with lot of fun.
    Who the hell has touched the other and caused the death of both players is
    the eternal question. Here is a link to
    <a href="http://nifflas.ni2.se/">Nifflas website</a>, the creator of the
    game.

    One day, I played this game with a friend and we both enjoyed it. But the
    game is very short and we were not completely satisfied. Because, yes, when
    you have spent a whole hour to complete a 90 seconds level which doesn't
    have a proper ending, you feel frustrated.
  </p>
  <p>
    So we decided to make our own version. The opportunity was gold to
    experiment with game development. For a simple game like this, playing
    directly in the browser is convenient, so the
    <a href="http://phaser.io/">Phaser</a> Javascript library has been our way
    to go. This game engine is simple and leverage the power of the WebGL
    renderer <a href="http://www.pixijs.com/">Pixi.js</a>. We also wanted
    procedurally generated levels. This adress the problem of the game being too
    short. So we made a seed-based system, where the seed is the name of the
    level.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here are some characteristics of the game :
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The game is playable in browser (Chrome or Firefox are recommended), with
      one keyboard for both player.
    </li>
    <li>
      The music along with some visual hints help the players to feel the swap
      tempo.
    </li>
    <li>
      All levels are potentially infinite. They are generated automatically
      according to a seed, and can be re-generated identically from the seed.
    </li>
    <li>
      The variety of levels is easily expandable because we use a concept of
      biome (as in Minecraft) to generate the levels.
    </li>
  </ul>
