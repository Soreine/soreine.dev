<p>
  Pixel Art Maker is a program I imagined when I was playing around with the
  dithering feature of image manipulation softwares like Gimp for
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_art">Pixel Art</a> purposes. I
  realised that the Bayer's positional dithering generated some crosshatch
  patterns and wondered how I could make an algorithm that would generate
  arbitrary patterns.
</p>

<p>The result is a combination of two image manipulation algorithms :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Generating an optimized limited color palette for an image.</li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither">Dithering</a> an image with an
    arbitrary color palette, using a user-defined pattern.
  </li>
</ul>

</a>

<p>
  The palette generation is made using a
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering"
    >K-means clustering</a
  >
  algorithm that tries to find the set of colors that average best the colors
  from the input image.
</p>

<p>
  The dithering is a positional ordered dithering algorithm, similar to the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_dithering"
    >Bayer ordered dithering algorithm</a
  >. However, instead of using the optimised Bayer matrix as a pattern, any
  grayscale image can be used as pattern source. This is destined to artists
  wanting to try out some unusual patterns in their creation. Draw a pattern
  image, define a palette and start the dithering. If the result is good, then
  it can be used and tweaked for a handmade piece of pixel art. If the result is
  not satisfying, it does not matter, try out something else, because it is
  fast.
